<p>Hi, I’m Pranav Duraivel – an acoustics engineer with a deep passion for sound and musical systems. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master’s in Acoustical and Vibration Engineering. My academic journey and industry experience span mechanical systems, computational acoustics, numerical modelling, along with hands-on exposure to MATLAB, Python and COMSOL Multiphysics.

My curiosity has always revolved around how systems work—be it a vibrating structure, a musical instrument, or a complex software environment. During my Master’s, I focused on vibroacoustic modelling, sound radiation, and finite element analysis. The project involved scanning and modelling an 18th-century square piano to analyse its acoustic behaviour. This work combined CT scanning, experimental testing (hammer test), and numerical optimisation, helping me develop advanced modelling skills using COMSOL Multiphysics, MATLAB, and other simulation tools.

Parallel to my acoustics work, I’ve also built a strong foundation in software development and machine learning. At IBM, I worked as a Mainframe Software Developer for Morgan Stanley, where I developed and maintained COBOL-based financial systems used in stock borrow, P&L reporting, and general ledger operations. I became proficient with JCL, NATURAL, and DB2, working on high-reliability systems used by one of the world's leading investment banks.</p>
